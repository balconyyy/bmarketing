# Testimonials Feature Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the implementation of a testimonials section on the BeMarketing website. This feature allows the business to showcase positive feedback from clients, enhancing credibility and trust.

## Components Created

### 1. TestimonialCard Component
- **File**: `components/testimonial-card.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays a single testimonial with client's photo, name, company, quote, and rating
- **Props**:
  - `image`: Path to the client's photo
  - `name`: Client's name
  - `company`: Client's company and position
  - `quote`: The testimonial text
  - `rating`: Star rating (1-5)

### 2. TestimonialsSection Component
- **File**: `components/testimonials-section.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Container for multiple testimonial cards in a responsive grid layout
- **Features**:
  - Responsive grid: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablets, 4 on desktops
  - Testimonial data is stored within the component

## Implementation

1. The testimonials section was added to the homepage between the features section and the work section
2. Placeholder images were added to the `/public` folder for the testimonial avatars
3. The section uses the same styling conventions as the rest of the site

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Data**: Connect testimonials to a CMS or API to make them dynamically updatable
2. **Carousel/Slider**: For mobile views, implement a swipeable carousel instead of a stacked grid
3. **Filtering**: Add ability to filter testimonials by industry or service type

## Usage

To add or modify testimonials, edit the `testimonials` array in `components/testimonials-section.tsx`. Each testimonial should include:

```typescript
{
  image: "/path-to-image.jpg",
  name: "Client Name",
  company: "Position, Company",
  quote: "Testimonial text...",
  rating: 5 // Rating from 1-5
}
```
